## Introduction

Few-shpt object detection on remote sensing images for DIOR horizontal bounding boxes.
Based on MMDetection object detection toolbox based on PyTorch which is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions to improve MMDetection. Ongoing projects can be found in out [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/projects). Welcome community users to participate in these projects. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributing guideline.

## Acknowledgement

MMDetection is an open source project that is contributed by researchers and engineers from various colleges and companies. We appreciate all the contributors who implement their methods or add new features, as well as users who give valuable feedbacks.
We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new detectors.

## Citation

The toolbox are from MMDetection project.
